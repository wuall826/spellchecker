## **Setup**

install the necessary Python packages using pip:

`pip install flask Werkzeug python-docx openpyxl`

To start the application, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

`python app.py`

Navigate to http://localhost:5000.

## **Approach**

In this spell checker application, the user can upload a text file and a dictionary file in .txt, .docx, or .xlsx format, and the application will identify any misspelled words in the text file based on the words found in the dictionary file. 

Some considerations I took into account while developing the application:

File Handling: The application needed to handle different file formats and read the contents of those files. I used the appropriate libraries (such as docx and openpyxl) and the built-in 'open' function to read the contents of different formats (.txt, .docx and .xlsx).

Spell Checking: To identify misspelled words, I compared the words from the input file with the words in the dictionary file. I used regular expressions to tokenize the words and created sets for efficient word lookup. So splitting the text into individual words, store those words in a data structure that allows for quick search. Any words not found in the dictionary were considered misspelled.

User Interface: I created a simple web interface using Flask and HTML. The user can upload the input and dictionary files, and the application displays the misspelled words in a list.

Validation and Error Handling: I added validation to ensure that both the input and dictionary files are uploaded. If any of the files are missing, the application prompts the user to upload them. I also handled unsupported file formats by displaying an error message.

## **Extension to Larger Project**

Customization: Allow users to customize the spell checker settings, such as choosing different dictionaries, adding their own custom dictionaries.

Spell Correction Suggestions: Enhance the spell checker to provide suggestions for correcting misspelled words. 

UI/UX Enhancements: Improve the user interface by adding more interactivity, such as live spell checking, highlighting misspelled words in the input text, and providing a more visually appealing design.

Performance Optimization: Optimize the spell checking algorithm and file handling operations for better performance, especially for large input files and dictionaries.
